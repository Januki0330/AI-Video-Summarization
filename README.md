# Video Processing Toolkit

This project is a Python-based toolkit for processing videos. It includes core functions for video analysis in `test.py`, additional helper functions in `functions.py`, and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter` in `test_ui.py`. The toolkit is modular, allowing users to run the core logic independently or interact with it through the UI.

## Features
- **Core Functionality**: Processes videos (e.g., local MP4 files or YouTube URLs) with customizable functions in `test.py`.
- **Helper Functions**: Modular utilities in `functions.py` for tasks like file handling or data processing.
- **Graphical Interface**: A `tkinter`-based UI in `test_ui.py` for user-friendly interaction.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new features by modifying `functions.py` or extending the UI.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher.
- **ffmpeg**: Required if your project involves audio or video processing (optional based on your implementation).
- **Conda**: Recommended for environment management.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Video-Processing-Toolkit
```
2. Set Up a Conda Environment
```bash

conda create -n videokit python=3.9
conda activate videokit
```

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages. Adjust this list based on your projectâ€™s needs (e.g., add pydub, speechrecognition, etc., if applicable):

```bash

pip install tkinter
```
If your project uses additional libraries, list them here. For example:
```bash
pip install pydub yt-dlp
```

4. Install ffmpeg (Optional)
If your project processes audio or video:

Windows:
Download ffmpeg from ffmpeg.org.
Extract and add the bin folder to your system PATH.
Verify: ffmpeg -version.
Linux:
```bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
 ``` 
MacOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
Project Structure
test.py: Core logic for video processing (no UI).
functions.py: Additional helper functions supporting the core logic.
test_ui.py: The tkinter-based GUI for interacting with the toolkit.
README.md: Project documentation.

Usage
1. Run the Core Logic (Without UI)
To use the core functionality directly:

```bash
conda activate videokit
python test.py
```
Modify test.py to accept inputs (e.g., file paths or URLs) as needed.
2. Run the UI
To launch the graphical interface:

```bash

conda activate videokit
python test_ui.py
```
Steps:
1. Open the UI.
2. Input a video file or URL (if supported).
3. Click buttons or follow prompts to process the video.
4 View results in the UI.


Example
Command Line:
```bash

python test.py --input "video.mp4"
```

UI:
```Launch test_ui.py, select "video.mp4" via the file browser, and click "Process".
Troubleshooting
"Module Not Found" Error:
Ensure all dependencies are installed (pip list to verify).
UI Not Responding:
Check for errors in the terminal. Ensure tkinter is installed correctly.
ffmpeg Errors (if applicable):
Verify ffmpeg is in your PATH: ffmpeg -version.
